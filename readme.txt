Machete is a lean and simple suite of tools that solve common WordPress annoyances: cookie bar, tracking codes, header cleanup

== Description ==

Machete is a simple suite of tools that solve common WordPress annoyances using as few resources as posible. Machete doesn't cover every single user case, but there is a huge amount of sites that would require less plugins if they used Machete.

All Machete tools have two things in common: they solve a problems faced by many web developers and they do it using as few server resources as possible.

So far, Machete includes the following tools:

= Header cleanup: =
WordPress places a lot of code inside the <head> tag just to keep backward compatiblity or enable optional features. You can disable most of it and save some time from each page request while making your installation safer.

= Cookie law warning: =
We know you hate cookie warning bars. Well, this is the less hateable cookie bar you'll find. It is really light, it won't affect your PageSpeed score and plays well with static cache plugins.

= Analytics and custom code: =
You don't need a zillion plugins to perform easy task like inserting a verification meta tag (Google Search Console, Bing, Pinterest), a json-ld snippet or a custom styleseet (Google Fonts, Print Styles, accesibility tweaks...).
The Google Analytics tracking code if PageSpeed optimized, GPDR friendly and has the option to track Contact Form 7 events.

= Maintenance mode: =
The maintenance mode that ships with WordPress is just a basic lockdown that is activated whenever you do a major update. With machete Maintenance Mode you can hide your uncomplete page from visitors and search engines, give your clients a secure temporary access and lock you site without affecting your SEO.

= Post & Page cloner: =
Adds a "duplicate" link to post, page and most post types lists. Also adds "copy to new draft" function to the post editor.

= Social Sharing Buttons: =
Social sharing made the Machete way. The icons are made as a custom webfont embedded in a CSS minified file that only weights 5.8Kb. The sharing actions are made uning each platform\'s native share URLs.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/machete` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Configure each tool using the corresponding link on the **Machete** side menu

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Doesn't plugin X does that better? =

Yes, but Machete does it well enough and probably is much lighter.

= Is there any set-it-and-forget it alternative to Machete? =

Machete is meant to be used as a development suite. If you are looking for a simpler solution to cut out WordPress bloat, you should have a look at WordPress [WPO Tweaks & Optimizations by fernando Tellado](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpo-tweaks/ "WPO Tweaks & Optimizations")

= Why does Wordfence show a warning when I save my options? =

Machete caches some of its options to files located in `wp-content\uploads\machete\` lo speed up loading. This is completely safe, but it's not a normal WordPress behaviour and it might make plugins like WordFence raise a warning. Just whilelist the action, save again and you'll be fine.

= Why doesn't Machete have an option to disable Gutenberg? =

Like it or not, the WordPress Block Editor (codenamed Gutenberg) is here to stay. Instead of disabling Gutenberg, you should be focusing on updating you workflow to use it. If you need to disable gutenberg during the transion, you should use the official [Classic Editor plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/)
