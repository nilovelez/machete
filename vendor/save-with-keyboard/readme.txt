This plugin lets you save your posts, pages, theme and plugin files in the most natural way: pressing Ctrl+S (or Cmd+S on Mac).

== Description ==

This plugin lets you save your posts, pages, theme and plugin files in the most natural way: pressing Ctrl+S (or Cmd+S on Mac).

I've coded this plugin because I was tired of pressing Cmd+S and then realize Chrome was trying to save the whole webpage :S

After coding this up, I've found in the plugin directory two plugins that did the same thing, but each one had some flaws that convinced me to publish mine.

This plugin loads a small Javascript file (minified if not WP_DEBUG). The Javascript checks the contents of any admin page for save buttons.

It is also *so* smart that it saves unpublished posts/pages as drafts and updates the ones that are already public.

Also adds a little tooltip on the buttons that can be "clicked" with Ctrl+S or Cmd+S.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the folder `save-with-keyboard` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is really so simple to install and use? =

You can bet it is.

= Where the shortcut is enabled? =

Everywhere!
If it's not a post, page, widget or link the plugin checks for the #submit or input[name=submit] selector (used in for instance theme, plugin and profile).
